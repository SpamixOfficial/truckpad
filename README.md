# The Truckpad - Ready for Calais /:\

Ever been driving your truck in ETS2 and realized that:
1. You have too few buttons for your 6 different types of honks?
2. Using a g29-scroll wheel to switch menu tab is janky?

Well oh boy do I have the solution for you! 

The Truckpad is a macropad specifically designed with these problems in mind. It has 4 switches + a modifier switch, which in total allows for up to 8 macros on the switches alone!

But this isn't enough (of course)...

You also need to be able to change tabs and do easy confirmation when fueling, so of course there's a rotary encoder to solve just that. It is also placed with your hand position in mind, so you don't have to do weird finger stretching to use it!

Last but not least it has an OLED screen where you can display information such as your nearest city in ETS2, or whatever you like really, the sky (and ETS2 modding capabilities ) is your limits!

Configuration is done in VIA, so no need to recompile the firmware!

The whole thing also comes in a small form factor so that's nice :D

**Here's also a list of features, in case you don't feel like reading all that!**
